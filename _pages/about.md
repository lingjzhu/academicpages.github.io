Hi! I am Jian Zhu, a Ph.D. candidate at [Department of Linguistics, University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/linguistics). I am also pursuing a joint Ph.D. in scientific computing at [The Michigan Institute for Computational Discovery and Engineering (MICDE)](https://midas.umich.edu/).

Briefly, my research focuses on two themes:  
1. To understand:  
  * how language variations and changes are shaped by cognitive and social factors, and   
  * how language is acquired and (ir)regularized among all the linguistic variations.     
2. To make speech and language technology accessible to the wider lingusitic community.   
   While people still debate over whether linguistics is helpful to NLP, it is undoubtedly that NLP will bebefit linguistic research immensely.
